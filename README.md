# Next-Level Gaming: A Portfolio CaseÂ Study
A data analysis for a fictional gaming company

ðŸ’¡ **Context**
Here I showcase my inaugural data analysis as a student of a Data Analytics Career Program. The analysis was conducted for the fictional gaming company GameCo, using a dataset provided by the educational institute. This dataset is designed for educational purposes and may not accurately represent real sales figures for the companies and video games mentioned.

ðŸ‘‰ **Foreword**
My very first project in data analysis turned out to leverage my past work experience and business-oriented mindset. Diving into the data for a fictional gaming company was appealing to me as a classic arcade and console gamer. The assignment initially seemed broad and unfocused, but I managed to set myself parameters to work within and found a strong angle to approach the challenge. Thanks to my natural tendency to seek explanations from multiple perspectives and dig deep into the numbers, I was able to uncover two specific, impactful findings.

ðŸ“Š **Executive Summary**
The board of GameCo is planning their annual budget for the upcoming year. They requested a data analysis to test their assumption that sales for the various geographic regions have stayed the same over time.

The analysis should provide insights that ultimately enhance ROI by allocating marketing funds based on top-performing game genres, pinpoint growth avenues through market and competitor analysis for expansion and investor relations, and drive market-level revenue by adjusting sales representative distribution according to market dominance.

## My key findings: 
* A significant market shift was observed for the first time in two decades, with Europe surpassing North America in global sales.
* The insight "Platform Power" demonstrates the importance of multi-platform availability in driving sales, particularly evidenced by the success of FIFA17 in Europe.
* The rise of mobile gaming as a new type of platform is reshaping the gaming landscape.

## Summary of recommendations: 
* **Genre Focus:** Bet on Sports and Role-Playing games for ROI, with a side of Action games for consistent performance.
* **Market Expansion:** Solidify GameCo's footing in Europe and explore emerging markets for timely expansion.
* **Filling the Void:** Seize opportunities in high demand gaming genres where giants like Nintendo and Activision have left gaps.
